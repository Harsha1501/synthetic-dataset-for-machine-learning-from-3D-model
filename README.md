# synthetic-dataset-for-machine-learning-from-3D-model
RESEARCH AIMS
This project is used for developing a CNN-based synthetic generation as a means of producing training data for machine learning based on a CAD model. 
A rendering tool like the blender application will be used to build training datasets and validation datasets from a CAD model or 3D model so that the images can be comprehended more thoroughly. 
These datasets will be prepared for both training and validation purposes. 
Python, which is a computer language, will be used in the process of importing and analyzing the data together with other libraries such as Keras and TensorFlow.

DATA SELECTION
The synthetic training dataset is made up of a CAD/3D model of Lego pieces. 
Brick 2 x 2, for instance, is a Lego part that has been rendered in a variety of different ways to show it from multiple perspectives. 
Lego training datasets consist of 3617 photos, with 400 of each category being included in the dataset. 
These rendered graphics are from the application known as Rebrickable. 
The application provides a location for us to locate a variety of Lego parts, Lego sets, and other Lego-related items. 
The test dataset contains a total of 891 photos, with 99 unique examples of each kind. 
This set of information includes 9 unique varieties of Lego pieces, which are as follows: Brick 1x1, Brick 1x2, Brick 2x2, Brick corner 1x2x2, Plate 1X2 with 1 Knob, Plate 1x1, Plate 1x2, Plate 2x2, Technic Lever 3M. 
In addition, this dataset includes three distinct families that are referred to as Brick, Lever, and Plate. 
The numerous Lego subsets are organized into their own families for the purpose of classification.
